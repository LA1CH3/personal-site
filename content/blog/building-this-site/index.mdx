I built my former personal website over the course of just a night or two several years ago. I was lazy; it was horribly designed, wasn't responsive, had no blogging functionality, but at least I had a cool typewriter animation on the homepage? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

For whatever reason, I recently decided now was the time I wanted to rebuild my site. I went through a number of designs, changed my mind on the technical approach multiple times, but ultimately landed on a minimalistic design built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/).

If you're interested, my experience with each tool is detailed below.

### Gatsby

I'm a huge fan of React, so its no surprise I'd want to use a tool like Gatsby for my own site.
